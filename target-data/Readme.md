# Target Data
This `target-data` folder contains the ground truth information about ILI and ARI incidence in EU/EEA countries extracted from [ERVISS](https://erviss.org/) and [FluID](https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/surveillance-and-monitoring/fluid). 

The [latest ILI file](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCast-SyndromicIndicators/blob/main/target-data/latest-ILI_incidence.csv) and the [latest ARI file](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCast-SyndromicIndicators/blob/main/target-data/latest-ARI_incidence.csv) report latest data merged from the two data sources.

In particular, the countries are divided into the two data sources as follows:

| Data Source | Countries (ISO-2 code) |

| ERVISS | AT, BE, CY, CZ, DK, EE, ES, FI, FR, GR, HR, HU, IE, IS, IT, LT, LU, LV, MT, NL, NO, PL, PT, RO, SI, SK|
